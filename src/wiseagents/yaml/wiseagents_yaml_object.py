        This does conversion of the keys read, which have no leading underscores to the internal representation

        Note: Subclasses MAY override this method, but need to be aware that the keys in the dictionary will not have
        underscores, and once done they will need to call this method via a super().__setstate__(d) call.

        Note: Rather than overriding __setstate__(), it is preferred to override _validate_and_convert_types(), which
        will be called once conversion has been done, and have the keys in the dictionary with underscores.
